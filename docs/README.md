## Introduction

Taking care of plants can be largely time consuming. Missing even a small scheduled task to the plant can result in drying up of the plant or even its death. Watering the plant, checking the amount of moisture in the soil are another very important and time consuming tasks. Another big problem in the houses(apartments) is the space.

But with the busy lifestyle people have less time and they don’t tend to plant trees and take care of them. As a solution to this problem, we are producing this smart pot to promote the concept, “plants as pets”. And this smart pot is also ideal for gardeners who are interested in planting plants like Bonsai where special conditions are needed.
